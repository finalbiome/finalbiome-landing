We're excited to announce a YouTube video showcasing the groundbreaking capabilities of our platform, FinalBiome.

In this 12-minute demo, we provide a deep dive into the workings of FinalBiome, using the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" as an example. We demonstrate how to easily configure game logic on the blockchain without writing a single line of code.

You'll see how gamers can truly own their in-game assets and how FinalBiome simplifies backend deployment for game developers.
